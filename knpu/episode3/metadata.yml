title:  RESTful APIs Episode 3: Documentation
summary: |
    **This episode is still being planned**. Writing documentation for
    your API is hard, and I'm still playing with ways that can read from
    our code but also give us enough flexibility. So far, I'm not happy.
    But if you're using Symfony2, check out the NelmioApiDocBundle. And
    stay tuned for updates :).

    In [Episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest), we learned
    the fundamentals. In  [Episode 2](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest-ep2)
    we took it a step further with linking, HATEOAS and pagination.

    In our last installment, we're talking about API documentation. Huh?
    Yep, unlike a traditional website, if your API docs have missing or
    out-of-date details, your API is just plain un-usable.

    In this tutorial, we'll experiment with an approach to creating a great
    API doc that's actually *reads* information from your code and updates
    dynamically. This is an area of growth: there are a lot of products and
    libraries to help. But there are also a lot of pieces missing - like
    how could I *actually* read my route information dynamically and use
    that in my API docs?

    Release is not yet scheduled - if you're eager to see this, let us know!
